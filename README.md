# 🛡️ Shield Insurance – Business Analytics Case Study (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my **Virtual Internship at Codebasics**, where I worked on a **real-world business analytics case study** for **Shield Insurance**.

The objective was not just to build dashboards, but to deliver:

- **Business-driven insights**
- **Clear analytical storytelling**
- **Decision-support analytics for stakeholders**

The final output is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed for management and business users.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Analyze **overall revenue and customer performance**
- Evaluate **sales mode effectiveness**
- Understand **age-group-based customer behavior**
- Identify **patterns that support strategic decisions**

---

## 🧱 Report Structure

The Power BI report consists of the following pages:

- **🏠 Home Page (Navigation Hub)**
- **📊 General View**
- **🧭 Sales Mode Analysis**
- **👥 Age Group Analysis**

---

# 🏠 Home Page – Navigation Hub

### 📸 Home Page Dashboard
<!-- INSERT HOME PAGE IMAGE HERE -->

### 📌 Purpose of this Page

- Serves as a **central navigation hub** for the entire report  
- Enables users to move smoothly between analysis pages  
- Provides **short business context** for each page before deep analysis  

### 🧠 Additional Enhancements

- **Support Panel** with quick-access options for business users  
- **Last data refresh date** displayed for transparency  
- Clear note on **data availability (Premium data up to April 2023)**  
- **UI refined from the original mockup** to reduce clutter and improve insight visibility  

> These UI changes were intentionally made to ensure the dashboard looks **professional, clean, and business-ready**, rather than visually overloaded.

# 📊 Page 1: General View

### 📸 General View Dashboard
<!-- INSERT GENERAL VIEW IMAGE HERE -->

### 📌 What This Page Shows

- **Total Revenue** and **Customer Count KPIs**
- **Monthly customer and revenue trends**
- **City-wise** and **age-group-wise** distribution

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Customer and revenue trends move closely together**, indicating that customer growth is the primary revenue driver.
- Noticeable **spikes in trends** suggest seasonal or campaign-driven performance.
- **Business contribution is uneven** — a small set of cities and age groups drive a large portion of results.
- Since **Offline Agent sales dominate customer acquisition**, changes in offline performance directly impact top-level KPIs.

### 💡 Business Meaning

This page establishes the **baseline performance** and explains *why* changes in sales mode and customer mix strongly influence overall business KPIs.

# 🧭 Page 2: Sales Mode Analysis

### 📸 Sales Mode Analysis Dashboard
<!-- INSERT SALES MODE PAGE IMAGE HERE -->

### 📌 What This Page Shows

- **Customer and revenue contribution** by sales mode  
- **Monthly customer trends** across each sales channel  

### 🔍 Key Insights

- **Offline Agent** remains the strongest contributor to both customers and revenue.
- **Offline Direct** shows a consistent decline over time.
- **Digital channels (App & Website)** demonstrate better stability and future growth potential.
- Even with a slight decline, **Offline Agent still delivers the highest volume**, making the business heavily dependent on it.

### 💡 Business Meaning

The business currently relies on **agent-driven sales**, while digital channels present an opportunity to **diversify risk and enable scalable growth**.

# 👥 Page 3: Age Group Analysis

### 📸 Age Group Analysis Dashboard
<!-- INSERT AGE GROUP PAGE IMAGE HERE -->

### 📌 What This Page Shows

- **Sales mode preference** by age group  
- **Policy preference patterns** across age segments  
- **Expected settlement percentage** by age  
- **Monthly customer trends** and overall customer distribution  

### 🔍 Key Insights

- The **31–40 age group** is the single largest contributor to customer growth.
- **Ages 31–50** together form the **core customer base** of the business.
- Younger customers (**18–30**) show:
  - Similar policy preferences  
  - Higher adoption of **digital sales modes**
- Older customers expect **higher settlement percentages**, explaining their strong reliance on **Offline Agents**.

### 💡 Business Meaning

Customer age strongly influences:

- **Sales mode preference**
- **Policy selection**
- **Claim expectations**

This makes **age-based segmentation critical** for strategic planning.
